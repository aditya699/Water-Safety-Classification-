# Water Classification Project

This project uses a combination of the latest technologies to make an ML-based Water Safety Classification system. Python, OOPS and Pycaret are used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building and model selection. Data Visualization is used to explore the data and interpret the results. AZURE is used for cloud deployment and Github for version control and collaboration. Advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods are used to get the best performance from the model. Finally, Streamlit is used to develop the web application
